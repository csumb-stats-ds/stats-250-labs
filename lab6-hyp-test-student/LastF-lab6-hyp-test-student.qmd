## Before you start:

1. Complete the Lab Primer linked in Canvas.  
2. Be sure you have opened the `lab6-hyp-test-student.Rproj` file.  
3. Change the name of the **QMD** file only to your last name, first initial, e.g., `OtterM-lab6-hyp-test-student.qmd`. You will have to close the QMD document to rename the file. 
4. Change the "NAME" above after `author:` to your name, leaving it in quotes: "Monte Otter"



## Skills

* Given a dataset, be able to determine if the appropriate assumptions are met to conduct a parametric hypothesis test using probability plots (qq plots) to assess the assumption of normality and exploratory data analysis to assess the guideline of equal variance  
* Explain that in order to determine if there is a relationship or underlying circumstance that explains the observed characteristics of our sample data, we must compare that observation of a perceived difference or relationship to what might occur simply by random chance.
* Identify and define the null and alternative hypothesis.  
* Evaluate p-values, test statistics and other information to assess the results of a hypothesis test.  
* Interpret a p-value in context
* Draw specific and general conclusions based on the results of the hypothesis test; interpret the information in context.
* Conduct statistical inference (confidence interval or hypothesis test) based on two independent samples   
* Utilize R-code to conduct two-sample statistical inferences (confidence intervals, hypothesis tests)   


These skills correspond to LTs 14, 15, 21a, and 22b and R LT R5.

## Part 1: Chicken Weights

Chicken farming is a multi-billion dollar industry, and any method that increases the growth rate of young chicks can reduce consumer costs while increasing company profits, possibly by millions of dollars. A study was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. A chicken farm in central California selected every n-th chick, where n is a random number between 1 and 10. Those chicks were randomly allocated into two groups, one which was fed a horsebean supplement and the other a linseed supplement. After six weeks, their weights in grams were recorded. The researchers are interested in determining which feed type is more effective at increasing weight and therefore growth rate of chickens. The data are stored in `chickwts.csv`.

      2b. Is the sample size sufficient? [Yes / No]; [Justification]  



### 1.5.

```{r}
#| label: calc-t-test-chicks

se <- [insert code to calculate standard error here]

t <- [insert code to calculate test statistic here]

df <- __n.smaller__ - 1

## To calculate p-value, based on alternative symbol - Choose the correct ONE code below based on the context; delete the others so that you only leave the one correct code to run.

# <
pt(t,df)

# >
1-pt(t, df)

# =/= and t < 0
2*pt(t, df)

# =/= and t > 0
2*(1-pt(t, df))
```

> Record the test statistic and p-value that is returned

### 1.6. 

Interpret your p-value in the context of the scenario. 

> There is a [insert p-value] probability of getting our test statistic of [symbol = insert test statistic] with degrees of freedom of [insert degrees of freedom] or [insert direction], if the [insert parameter of interest] is [insert null value].   


### 1.7.  

Provide a strength of evidence statement from your p-value, in the context of the scenario, using a significance level of 0.05.    

> Insert answer here   


### 1.8. 

Calculate the 95% confidence interval (CI) for the parameter of interest. Calculate, using numerical summary functions in R, as well as one line of code to determine the critical value (denoted by t*). Remember that you've already calculated your standard error in part 1.5.

```{r}
#| label: calc-ci-chicks
pe <- [insert code to calculate point estimate here]

cv <- [insert code to calculate t* here]

# Calculate lower bound and upper bound using previously stored values (remember you alreaqdy calculated some values previously)
(lb_wts <- _____ - _____*____)
(ub_wts <- _____ + _____*____)
```


### 1.9. 

Provide a second piece of evidence from EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) that supports the results of the hypothesis test in determining which feed type is more effective at increasing weight of chicks. Be sure to cite your evidence and make a conclusion about the parameter.

## Part 2: Exxon Valdex Oil Spill   

Following the March 24, 1989 grounding of the oil tanker the Exxon Valdez in Alaska, approximately 35,500 tons of crude oil was released into Prince William Sound.  The paper, “The deep benthos of Prince William Sound, Alaska, 16 months after the Exxon Valdez oil spill” [Marine Pollution Bulletin (1998), 36: 118-130] reports on an evaluation of the organisms, benthic macrofauna, that live in the sea-bed after the spill.  Thirteen sites were selected for study.  Seven of the sites were within the oil spill trajectory (affected by the oil) and six were outside the oil trajectory (not affected by the oil).  Collection of the data occurred at two depths, 40m and 100m, occurred in the period of July 1-23, 1990.  One of the variables measured was abundance of the benthic macrofauna (individuals per square meter) at both 40m and 100m.  The measures of abundance at each depth are represented in our data as `Depth40m` and `Depth100m`.  For our study, we will be focusing on the abundance of the benthic macrofauna (individuals per square meter) at 40m to determine if there is still an effect of the oil spill by comparing site locations within the oil spill trajectory and outside the oil spill trajectory. Use the order of the difference `Within - Outside`.   



### 2.1.

### 2.3.  

Read in the data from your csv file `oil-spill.csv` and use `mutate()` to re-order the levels of the categorical explanatory variable to set the order of the difference `Within - Outside`.

### 2.10.  

Based on your confidence interval, is there evidence that there is still an effect of the oil spill? What can you conclude about the abundance of the benthic macrofauna (individuals per square meter) at 40m between sites **outside** the oil spill trajectory and sites **within** the oil spill trajectory? Explain and justify your answer in the context of the study.  

> Insert answer here  


### 2.11.  

Can the researchers determine if the oil spill *caused* any differences in the abundance of the benthic macrofauna (individuals per square meter) at 40m of sites **within** the oil spill trajectory and **outside** the oil spill trajectory? Justify your answer fully.
