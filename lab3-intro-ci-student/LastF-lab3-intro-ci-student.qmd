## Skills

* Describe and identify sampling techniques and any potential biases from them.  
* Write a statistical research question which clearly defines the purpose, population, parameter, and variable of interest.  
* Describe the sampling distribution of a statistic and define the standard error of a statistic.  Be able to distinguish the standard deviation from the standard error.  
* Calculate the standard error.  
* Given a study, describe the sampling distribution of $\bar{x}$ as specifically as possible.   
* Explain that in order to estimate the population parameter, we must quantify the uncertainty from our point estimate.  
* Identify and define the population and parameter of interest in a given study.  
* Construct and interpret a confidence interval in the context of the problem.  
*	Draw conclusions that apply to the population based on the results of the confidence interval; interpret the information in context.  
* Make graphs in R to represent a numeric variable.

These skills correspond to LTs 1, 2, 5, and 6, and R LT R2.

## Part 1: Data Collection: Southern bull-kelp

A researcher was interested in examining long-distance dispersal of drifting southern bull-kelp (*Durvillaea antarctica*) adults in the New Zealand Canterbury Bight to understand connectivity between coastal populations. (Collins et al. 2010. Mol. Ecol.) (Invertebrates can 'raft' on the detached kelp, which also remains alive until beach-cast, allowing long-distance dispersal events to occur.) Given part of their written methods below, answer the questions that follow. 

**Methods** (excerpt)
Collection of beach-cast *D. antarctica* samples from seven field sites spanning the Canterbury Bight region was performed in March 2009 and again in April/May 2010. At individual field sites, we typically sampled across approximately 0.5-2.0 km of coastline. Where possible, we sampled only the beach-cast specimens that included a holdfast and/or primary stipe to ensure that individuals were not sampled more than once. In the cases (primarily in 2010) where relatively low numbers of intact specimens were found at some sites, we collected tissue from large pieces of *D. antarctica* that were clearly separated (e.g. >20 m) from other such pieces, again to avoid repeated sampling of individual specimens. We generally targeted specimens stranded at or above the high tide mark and sampled the dried tips of their fronds to maximize success with DNA extraction. Typically, between 20 and 30 samples were collected per site per year, with a small piece (a few cm) of frond tissue preserved in 95% ethanol before being transferred to silica gel.

## Part 3: Data Collection - Ideal Outdoor Temperature 

We are interested in the ideal outdoor temperature of Californians.


### 3.1.

Collect your own sample of *at least* 30 Californians for the variable of ideal outdoor temperature (in Fahrenheit). Decide how to take your sample using any sampling method we've learned and collect the data. 

Once you have collected your data, make a `.csv` file (you can use Excel or GoogleSheets) with a single column with a heading/column name like `temp`. Record your data for the 30 individuals you sample in column in the file. Name the file `LastF-temp.csv`.  Then upload the `.csv` file into your Lab 3 folder.

Next read in your created data as taught in class, assigning it to the object name `ca`, replacing the underscored parts of the code below.

```{r}
#| label: read-temp-data

_objectname_ <-  __import_data__("__datafilename.csv___")
head(ca)
```


### 3.2.

What sampling method did you use? Describe and identify the sampling method. Any possible biases present? Justify your answers and be as specific as needed.   

> Description of collection method:     
> Sampling Design Name & any biases:    
> Justification:   


### 3.3.

## Part 4: Inference: Estimating ideal outdoor temperature

We are interested in estimating the actual value of the ideal outdoor temperature of all Californians.


### 4.1.

What is the statistical research question?

> Insert answer here   


### 4.2.

What is the population of interest in this study? Remember to be as specific as needed.

> Insert answer here     


### 4.3. 

What is the parameter of interest in this study?

> [insert appropriate markdown symbol here] = [state parameter of interest in words]     


### 4.4. 

Fill in the table describing what each symbol represents, whether it represents a parameter or a statistic, and the calculated values of each in this context, if known. You may need to insert a code chunk to calculate the values that can be known. Type "NA" in the cell, if unknown.

Symbol    | Description        | parameter or statistic? | Calculated Value if possible (with units)
--------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------
$\mu$     |                    |                         |          
$\bar{x}$ |                    |                         |           
$s$       |                    |                         |           
$n$       |                    |                         |            



### 4.5.

Check the conditions for constructing a confidence interval on your data. The conditions are listed, you just need to answer if they were met and justify why in the context of the question, including context or evidence from your study.

> 1. Random sample: [Met?]; [Justification]  

> 2. Normality or Sufficient sample size:  [Met?]
      2a. Is the sample from a Normally distributed population or does the sample data have a roughly bell-shaped or symmetric distribution? [Yes / No]; [Justification]       
      2b. Is the sample size sufficient? [Yes / No]; [Justification]
      


### 4.6. 

Let's use a model to find a 95% confidence interval.    
- Go to: http://www.rossmanchance.com/applets/2021/tbia/TBIA.html   
- Change the scenario to 'one mean'  
- Enter your sample's $n$, $\bar{x}$, and $s$ into the fields, then 'calculate'  
- Click "Confidence Interval".  
- Enter the correct confidence level.  
- Click 'Calculate.'  
- The confidence interval and degrees of freedom are displayed.    


> Record the calculated confidence interval and degrees of freedom that is returned
> CI = (____, ____), df = ____


### 4.7. 

Interpret your confidence interval from 4.6 in the context of the question.

> Based on our sample, we are **[insert confidence level]** that the **[write parameter of interest]** is a single value between **[insert lower bound value]** and **[insert upper bound value]** **[insert units]**.    


### 4.8.

Is there evidence from Exploratory Data Analysis that the ideal outdoor temperature of Californians is more than 78? Be sure to cite the evidence, as well as describe why it supplies evidence for the value of the parameter.  

> Insert answer here   


### 4.9.

Based on the sample you took, can we generalize to the population of interest? Why or why not? If so, explain why. If not, explain why and, if applicable, the population that could be generalized to.

> Insert answer here     


### 4.10. 

To use the model to calculate the confidence interval, a condition/conditions from 4.5 needed to be satisfied. Which condition(s) are they, and what if you hadn't met that condition? What would that mean for your conclusion?
