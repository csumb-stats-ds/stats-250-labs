## Part 1: Run differential  

Baseball is a game for statistics lovers. The run differential is defined as the number of runs between the winning and losing teams' scores. For example, if the Giants score 5 and the Dodgers score 7, the run differential of this game is -2 from the Giantsâ€™ perspective. One particular statistic is the mean run differential. You'd like to know if your favorite team is, on average, winning games (having a mean run differential greater than zero). Suppose you recorded the run differential for your favorite team for a random sample of games through the season. Your data are in a vector called `Run.Diff` in the file `run-differential.csv`. Load in the data below.  

```{r}
#|label: rundiff-data

baseball <- _____(______)
```


### 1.1.

Before conducting any inference, such as a confidence interval, it is recommended that we perform exploratory data analysis. In the code chunk below, calculate the sample size, mean, and standard deviation and create a boxplot of the data in `baseball` for `Run.Diff`. For an appropriate graphic, do not forget to label axes for readers. Then also write the statistics using mathematical notation, and describe them verbally in context, below the code chunk.

### 1.2.

Have the conditions been met to construct a Student's t confidence interval? The conditions are listed, you just need to answer if they were met and justify why in the context of the question, including context or evidence from your study, by replacing the [prompts].  

< Insert code chunk as needed here >  

> 1. Random sample: [Met?]; [Justification]  
  2. Normality or Sufficient sample size:  [Met?]  
      2a. Is the sample from a Normally distributed population or does the sample data have a roughly bell-shaped or symmetric distribution? [Yes / No]; [Justification]       
      2b. Is the sample size sufficient? [Yes / No]; [Justification]  


 
### 1.3.

Calculate the 95% confidence interval, using the `t.test()` function. Modify the code below by replacing the blanks.  

```{r}
#|label: rundiff-CI

t.test(______, data = ______, conf.level = ______)$conf.int
```


 
### 1.4. 

Interpret your confidence interval in the context of the scenario.

### 1.5. 

Based on your confidence interval, is there evidence that your favorite team is winning on average (having a mean run differential greater than zero)?  

> Insert answer here  



### 1.6. 

Suppose you decided to take a second sample to revisit and revise your question. This time, instead of selecting *any* game throughout the season, you randomly select 10 games *only* from games played at your favorite team's stadium and calculate a confidence interval for the true mean run differential.  

Consider the two sampling methods: (i) You randomly sample 35 games throughout the season, (ii) You randomly selected 10 games played at your favorite team's stadium throughout the season. Discuss the consequences of these two sampling methods by answering: If possible, what population can you generalize to? How does the sample size affect your results?

## Part 2: Liver Enzyme Indicators  

Heavy metals are dangerous and long lasting pollutants, but which can be hard to detect in water samples. Organisms possess a suite of enzymes that can metabolize toxins that enter their systems. Monitoring whether these enzymes are elevated, or in other cases, if certain enzymes that are inhibited by heavy metals are depressed, in organisms can be used as an indicator of the presence of heavy metals in the ecosystem.  

The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), measured in the liver of bluegill fish (*Lepomis macrochirus*), is an indicator enzyme of heavy metal contamination. Data are recorded as units of SOD activity per mg protein (unit / mg pr). Enzyme activities of less than 60 units / milligram protein indicate the presence of heavy metals and less than 45 units/ milligram protein are taken to indicate a heavily polluted systems from heavy metals. Researchers are monitoring the bluegill which live in Ohio rivers. For all river locations that are accessible by boat or land, the researchers overlay a numbered grid and use a random number generator to select grids to attempt catching the fish. Any bluegill caught was measured for their SOD activity. The researchers are interested in determining if the enzyme activities are depressed (i.e. heavy metals are in the rivers above normal levels) in the Ohio bluegill. The data are in the variable `SOD` inside the file `liver-enzyme.csv`. Load in the data below.

### 2.2.

From the data, calculate the statistics listed in the following table, and then fill in the table with the statistics and parameters. If a parameter is unknown, write "NA." You can round to four decimal points as needed to enter the values. 

```{r}
#| label: sod-stats

# calculate statistics, annotating your code to describe what descriptive statistic each line calculates

> Insert answer here.  



### 2.7. 

Interpret your confidence interval in the context of the problem. 

> Insert answer here.   



### 2.8. 

SOD concentrations less than *45 units / mg protein* indicate a large amount of heavy metal contamination in the rivers. Based on the confidence interval, do you think the mean SOD concentration in bluegill found in Ohio rivers is low enough to indicate a large amount of heavy metal contamination (i.e., average SOD concentration less than 45)? Explain your reasoning in context.  

> Insert answer here.  



### 2.9. 

SOD concentrations for bluegill fish in uncontaminated water are typically over *60 units / mg protein.* Based on your confidence interval, is there evidence that SOD concentrations, on average, are depressed from a smaller amount of heavy medal pollution than would be considered "heavy pollution?" Explain your reasoning in context.    

> Insert answer here.  



### 2.10. 

Provide a second piece of evidence from EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) that supports the results of the confidence interval in answering whether the SOD concentration in bluegill fish in Ohio rivers has any heavy metals present (i.e., average SOD concentration less than 60).

> Insert answer here.  


### 2.13. 

For each of the following, indicate if it is a correct or incorrect interpretation of the confidence interval you calculated in 2.6. Provide an explanation for each.

a. There is a 95% chance that the true mean SOD concentration is between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.

> Correct or Incorrect?  
> Explain.  


b. 95% of the sample SOD concentrations will be between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval. 

> Correct or Incorrect?  
> Explain.  


c. Suppose we repeat this study, sampling and calculating a 95% confidence interval many times. 95% of the time, the true mean SOD concentration will be between the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval. 5% of the time, it will not.

> Correct or incorrect?  
> Explain.  



### 2.14. 

All else being equal, if the researchers repeat simple random sampling from the same population, how would the following changes influence the width of a confidence interval? (For each, choose one answer from the brackets and **bold** it, then write a *brief* justification below.    

a. Increased confidence level (1-$\alpha$): [Wider, Narrower, No Influence]  

> Justification  


b. Smaller sample size (n): [Wider, Narrower, No Influence] 

> Justification  


c. Larger standard deviation: [Wider, Narrower, No Influence]  

> Justification
